                        <p>
                            I am a hardworking, reliable and motivated person, always willing to learn new skills and take on challenges. I am currently a first-year student at Canterbury Christ Church university studying Software Engineering. 
Whilst in secondary school I was chosen to be a senior prefect as well as a peer mentor. These duties alongside my outside interests, and two and a half years in retail have helped me in creating and maintaining good relationships, communication skills as well as a valid team member.

                            I have been a member of the Scouting movement for the last 8 years.  I am now a Young leader at 1st Peters cub scout group. Where I use my social, communication and leadership skills, in helping with the planning and running of the weekly activities. As a young leader I have undertaken training involving, first aid, child protection and understanding behaviour. 
                            I have completed my Duke of Edinburgh award which I am waiting to be signed off. As part of my DofE I had to learn a new skill. I choose Makaton. Which is basic form of sign language, for people with communication difficulties.
