                        <h2>Profile</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am a hardworking, reliable and motivated person, always willing to learn new skills and take on challenges. I am currently a first-year student at Canterbury Christ Church university studying Software Engineering. 
Whilst in secondary school I was chosen to be a senior prefect as well as a peer mentor. These duties alongside my outside interests, and two and a half years in retail have helped me in creating and maintaining good relationships, communication skills as well as a valid team member.
